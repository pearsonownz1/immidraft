Dear USCIS Officer,

My name is Dr. Davide Piovesan, and I hold a Ph.D. in Biomechanics from the University of Milan. I am currently the Research Director at the European Institute of Biomechanics, where I lead a multidisciplinary team investigating human movement, rehabilitation technologies, and prosthetic design. With over 15 years of experience in the field, I have published more than 40 peer-reviewed articles in leading journals, presented at numerous international conferences, and collaborated with major medical device companies to develop innovative rehabilitation solutions.

I am writing this letter to provide my expert opinion regarding the extraordinary ability of the beneficiary in the field of biomechanics and rehabilitation engineering. After a thorough review of the beneficiary's academic background, research contributions, and professional achievements, I can confidently state that they meet the criteria for classification as an individual of extraordinary ability in this specialized field.
