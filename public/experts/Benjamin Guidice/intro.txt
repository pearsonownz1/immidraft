Dear USCIS Officer,

My name is Dr. Benjamin Guidice, and I hold a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from Stanford University. I am currently a Senior Research Engineer at the National Engineering Research Center, where I lead a team focused on advanced materials and manufacturing processes. With over 12 years of experience in the field, I have published more than 30 peer-reviewed articles in leading journals and have been granted 5 patents for innovative engineering solutions.

I am writing this letter to provide my expert opinion regarding the extraordinary ability of the beneficiary in the field of mechanical engineering. After thoroughly reviewing the beneficiary's academic background, professional experience, and significant contributions to the field, I can confidently attest that they meet the criteria for classification as an individual of extraordinary ability.
