Dear USCIS Officer,

My name is Dr. Haife Shi, and I hold a Ph.D. in Materials Science from Stanford University. I am currently the Principal Investigator at the Advanced Materials Research Institute, where I lead a team of scientists developing novel materials for energy storage, electronics, and biomedical applications. With over 14 years of experience in the field, I have published more than 50 peer-reviewed articles in high-impact journals, secured 9 patents, and received multiple research grants from both government agencies and private industry.

I am writing this letter to provide my expert opinion regarding the extraordinary ability of the beneficiary in the field of materials science and engineering. After a thorough review of the beneficiary's academic credentials, research contributions, and professional achievements, I can confidently state that they meet the criteria for classification as an individual of extraordinary ability in this specialized field.
